# Odd-Even Numbers Dashboard  

> *Started with a simple function → evolved into a real-time web dashboard.*

This project documents my **step-by-step growth** in:  
- core programming logic  
- Git branching & pull requests  
- debugging / compiling  
- frontend + backend integration for dashboards  

Each feature lives on its own branch, showing clear progression: **logic ➝ streams ➝ graphs ➝ web**.

## 📈 Timeline / Roadmap  

1. **Core Logic (Branches 1–4)** → basic function, one-liner refactor, pseudocode, multi-language.  
2. **Collections (Branches 5–7)** → move from single numbers → lists → grouped outputs.  
3. **Streaming (Branches 8–9)** → infinite streams & automated real-time inputs.  
4. **Persistence (Branch 10)** → file logging of odd/even values.  
5. **Visualization (Branches 11–12)** → graphs, dashboard UI basics.  
6. **Web App (Branches 13–15)** → Flask backend, Chart.js visuals, live ticker feed.

## 🧑‍💻 Skills  

- **Programming** → functions, lists, grouping, return values  
- **Debugging** → compile/runtime fixes, backend ↔ frontend issues  
- **Java** → writing, compiling, and running small programs  
- **File I/O** → logging results to disk  
- **Visualization** → Matplotlib (Python), Chart.js (line/pie/gauge)  
- **Backend** → Flask routes + JSON APIs  
- **Frontend** → charts, live ticker updates, dashboard UI  
- **Version Control** → branching, incremental commits, PR workflow  
- **Integration** → stitched logic into a working real-time web app

## ✅ Summary  

A single odd/even function evolved into a **mini analytics dashboard** with:  

- real-time number streaming  
- persistent logging  
- interactive graphs (line, pie, gauge)  
- live feed ticker in the UI
